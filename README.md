# Launch a Phishing Simulation Campaign



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dcc435a-1198-4e57-ab5a-c489b4eef6d1)

In Microsoft Defender’s Attack Simulation Training, "Phishing" is the general category — but when you go into the simulation setup, it offers specific attack techniques that simulate different types of phishing attacks.

🎯 What We are Seeing = Phishing Techniques (Subtypes)
Here’s what each option means:

Credential Harvest	Sends a fake login page to steal usernames/passwords	✅ Yes	✅ Best option for beginner simulation
Malware Attachment	Sends a malicious file as an attachment	✅ Yes	Good for advanced cases
Link in Attachment	Email has an attachment that contains a malicious link	✅ Yes	
Link to Malware	A link in the email directly downloads malware	✅ Yes	
Drive-by URL	A link that silently tries to exploit the browser	✅ Yes	
OAuth Consent Grant	Tricks user into giving access to apps via OAuth	✅ Yes	
How-to Guide	Just an informational help guide (not a technique)	❌ No	Just for reference

✅ Best Option for My Assignment
Select:
🔹 Credential Harvest

Why?
It simulates a fake login page (like Outlook or Microsoft login)

It's the most common phishing method

Easy to track: users click the link → enter dummy credentials → results show up in your dashboard

📌 What to Do Now:
Select Credential Harvest

Click Next

Continue the rest of the simulation setup:

Name the simulation

Choose a payload/template (e.g., fake Microsoft login)

Select your test users (like AdeleV, MiriamG)



# Adding my Target Users

# Submit

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cd3fdc2-f6a9-4c2e-84f5-adf9c1eea817)


✅ What Happened After Submission
The phishing simulation is scheduled to:

Start: June 10, 2025, at 2:03 AM

Targets: 3 users

✅ Technique: Credential Harvest

✅ Status: Scheduled

🕒 What Happens Next
Within a few minutes (or at the scheduled time), each of the target users will receive a phishing email (e.g., a fake Microsoft login or password alert).

👣 What We Should Do Next
🔹 Step 1: Log in as One of the Test Users 
Pick one of the test users you targeted. Example:

( logged in as Test Azure1 test CS Lab1)

How to Log In:
Lets Go to 👉 https://outlook.office.com

Enter the user’s email and password

Open their inbox

Look for the phishing simulation email

Click the phishing link

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab844945-92cb-42d8-a947-affb18732f36)



🔹 Step 2: Go Back to Admin Dashboard and Track
Go to: https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator

Click on your campaign name ( Phishing )

We’ll see:

✅ Who clicked the link

✅ Who submitted credentials

✅ Whether Microsoft Defender detected the attack

✅ If auto-remediation actions (like email removal) were taken

# 4: Configure IAM (Identity and Access Management) with Azure AD Free

🎯 Goal:
Set up IAM (Identity and Access Management) using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD Free). This includes:

Creating user groups like SOC Analyst and IT Admin

Assigning RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) using built-in roles

Setting up a Conditional Access policy (e.g., IP/location restriction)



🛠️ Prerequisites:
Before starting, we have to make sure:

We’re signed in as the Global Administrator (the admin account you created earlier — e.g., admin@shahriar143.onmicrosoft.com )

We have access to the Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com


🧭 Step-by-Step Instructions
🔹 Step 1: Go to Azure Active Directory
Open browser and go to 👉 https://portal.azure.com

Sign in with your admin credentials ( admin@shahriar143.onmicrosoft.com /  **** d***!)

In the left-side menu, click on “Microsoft Entra" --> WHich is new name for Azure Active Directory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b4a74c-e443-4449-9fb5-90bc20089383)


✅ We're now in the Azure AD control center



# 🔹 Step 2: Create New Groups
We will create two groups:

SOC Analyst

IT Admin

🔸 How to Create Each Group:
In Azure AD, click “Groups”

Click + New group

Now fill in the form:

Field	Value
Group type	Security
Group name	SOC Analyst
Group description	Group for Security Operations Center analysts
Membership type	Assigned
Members	Click “No members selected” and choose 1–2 test users (e.g., testazure1)


Click Create


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/456169a0-bd84-49b3-9910-80de262424a6)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda7c9aa-2f62-40d0-a439-f71f8f1a4533)






📌 We will repeat these steps again to create the "IT Admin" group.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f908bb-d3d9-4824-9074-f0d309bbf443)


🔹 Step 3: Assign RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Using Built-in Roles
✅ Why Built-in Only?
Azure AD Free doesn’t support custom roles — we can only use built-in roles like:

User Administrator

Security Reader

Global Reader

Intune Administrator

🔸 Assign a Role to a Group

Go back to Azure AD home

Click “Roles and administrators”
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3ec16e3-d177-4e7c-8d7a-fb115a7873b1)


Scroll and choose a role like:

Security Reader → good for SOC Analyst

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98803c56-ed91-4175-acd7-58fffceab740)


User Administrator or Intune Administrator → for IT Admin

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad08e1b2-499d-4953-8dc6-25398028deeb)






Click the role name (e.g., Security Reader)

Click + Add assignments
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b1b4be-d866-4413-b848-1dbad6f14d6a)


In the Add Assignment panel:

Search and select SOC Analyst group

Click Add

📌 Repeat for the IT Admin group using a different role.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7db4016b-ca59-48a3-ac37-0b28c8b77aaf)





🔹 Step 4: Configure Basic Conditional Access Policy (IP/Location Restriction)
✅ Even though Conditional Access is mostly a Premium P1 feature, you can create 1 basic policy in free tenants for learning/demo purposes.

🔸 How to Create a Basic Policy:
In Azure AD, go to Security → Conditional Access

Click + New policy
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf1600a3-3881-4a05-bc69-00176e9f2d1f)


Give it a name: Restrict Sign-in by IP


Under Assignments → Users or workload identities

Click Select users and groups


Select SOC Analyst group

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e48c5db7-8b8a-4904-8138-5be7c6c5ed72)

Under Assignments → Conditions → Locations
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22187be8-0f46-41ec-a356-3bfb79eed09f)


Enable Configure → Choose Yes

Click Include → Select Any location

Click Exclude → Select Trusted locations or add specific IPs (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24)

Under Access Controls → Grant

Choose Block access OR Require MFA

Click Enable Policy → On

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f17e059f-91a5-4e44-bbbf-8af336bee9a7)

System will ask to disable default security - Let's do it 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d8c60c-2ed8-436d-b828-8fa2f447c3e3)


Click Create
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4effbe3-b4fc-4887-ac7a-d7036fb6e78b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d08c78-a20a-48cb-b998-67f91efe17f4)

# ----------------------------------------------

🧪 Example Scenario:

Groups:

SOC Analyst → assigned to Security Reader role

IT Admin → assigned to User Administrator role

Conditional Access Policy:

Blocks SOC Analyst users from logging in unless they're from a trusted location/IP

✅ Summary / Conclusion: 
Task	Completed
Created SOC Analyst group	✅
Created IT Admin group	✅

- **Tactics:** Initial Access


  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a04aa7a-c66b-49da-add7-a47b77148dfa)


  ### 🔍 Set Rule Logic:

In the **Query** section, paste the following sample:

```kusto
EmailEvents
| where ThreatType == "Phish" and DeliveryAction == "Clicked"
```

This is a simple KQL (Kusto Query Language) query that detects phishing click events.

Let's break down the full query line-by-line, explain what each part does, and give context so you can confidently explain it to your faculty.

#### ####### The Full Query:

kusto

EmailEvents

| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"

| where DeliveryAction == "Clicked"

| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, DeliveryAction, ThreatTypes

📚 Background Concepts You Should Know First

🛡 What is Microsoft Sentinel?

A cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution from Microsoft.
It collects and analyzes security data from various sources (like Entra ID, Microsoft 365, firewalls, etc.).
It helps security teams detect threats, investigate incidents, and respond effectively.
📦 What is KQL?

Kusto Query Language is used to write queries for analyzing data in Azure Log Analytics and Sentinel.
It is read-only, meaning you only fetch and analyze data — not modify it.
📊 What is EmailEvents?

A log table in Sentinel that stores data about email-related events, like deliveries, detections, threats, actions taken, etc.
When you connect Sentinel with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (via Entra ID or Microsoft 365), EmailEvents becomes available.
🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Query

🔹 Line 1:

kusto

EmailEvents

✅ What it does:

Selects the data source — specifically the EmailEvents table.
This is your starting point: you’re telling Sentinel, “Look at all email-related events.”
🔹 Line 2:

kusto

| where ThreatTypes has "Phish"

✅ What it does:

Filters the events to only those where the ThreatTypes column contains the word "Phish" (short for Phishing).
ThreatTypes is often a list of threat categories (like ["Phish", "Spam", "Malware"]), so we use has instead of ==.
🧠 Analogy:

Think of ThreatTypes like a "tag cloud" for each email — and you’re asking, “Show me only the emails that have the Phish tag.”

🔹 Line 3:

kusto

| where DeliveryAction == "Clicked"

✅ What it does:

Narrows down further to only those emails that were not just phishing, but where the user actually clicked the malicious link.
DeliveryAction records what the recipient did or what the email system did (e.g., Clicked, Blocked, Delivered, etc.)
🎯 Why it’s important:

We're not just looking for phishing — you're targeting phishing incidents where someone fell for it. This makes the alert much more valuable.

🔹 Line 4:

kusto

| project TimeGenerated, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, DeliveryAction, ThreatTypes

✅ What it does:

Selects specific columns to show in the result.
project is like saying: “Only show me the columns I care about.”
🔎 Columns Explained:

Column Name

What It Shows

TimeGenerated

When the event was logged (timestamp)

SenderFromAddress

The email address that sent the email

RecipientEmailAddress

The user who received the email

Subject

The subject line of the phishing email

DeliveryAction

The action taken (e.g., Clicked)

ThreatTypes

The type of threat detected (e.g., Phish, Malware, etc.)

🛑 We’re creating a query that:

Detects phishing emails
That were delivered
And clicked by the user (a sign of compromise or risky behavior)
🎯 Use Case: Alert for “Phishing Click Event”

Now that you’ve got the query, we can:

Test it in the “Logs” section of Sentinel
Save it as a Detection Rule or Analytics Rule
Set it to run every X minutes
Trigger an alert when results are found
(Optional) Connect to Playbooks for automated response (e.g., send email, disable user, etc.)
✅ Summary for the query:

"This query is used in Microsoft Sentinel to detect instances where a phishing email was not only received, but also clicked by a user — indicating potential compromise. It filters the EmailEvents log for threat type Phish and a delivery action of Clicked, then displays key details like sender, recipient, and timestamp. This helps security teams prioritize high-risk events and respond quickly."


Once you save the query:
## 🛎️ Set Alert Details:
- **Alert rule frequency:** Every 5 minutes
- **Lookup data source:** SentinelWorkspace

Click **Next** through all tabs and finally click **Create**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/325c1385-a7ab-4399-a3a9-b74cb053891c)



---

## 🧪 Test Summary

- Created and configured Microsoft Sentinel
- Connected Microsoft Entra ID  and Azure Activity
- Built a working alert rule that detects phishing click events from email logs


📌 Summary for the Report

“We created a scheduled analytics rule in Microsoft Sentinel that continuously monitors email activity logs for phishing emails that users have clicked. This helps detect real security incidents and assigns them to our SOC analyst group for investigation. The rule is based on a custom KQL query that filters the EmailEvents table for ‘Phish’ threats and a ‘Clicked’ action, providing actionable alerts for potential user compromise.”
