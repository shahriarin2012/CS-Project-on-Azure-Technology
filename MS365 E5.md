#🔁 Alternate Option: Create a Free Trial Microsoft 365 E5 Tenant (Not Developer Program)
Since the Developer Program isn’t allowing access, we can create a 30-day trial tenant directly from the Microsoft 365 admin portal. This will give you access to Attack Simulation Training.

✅ Step-by-Step: Set Up a Microsoft 365 E5 Trial with Admin Access
🔹 Step 1: Go to the Microsoft E5 Trial Page
Open this link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e5

Click “Try for free”

🔹 Step 2: Create a New Account
Click Next to begin sign-up

Fill out:

First Name / Last Name

Business email → (Use any email — doesn’t need to be real)

Company Name → e.g., "Student Lab"

Country

You’ll be prompted to:

Create a new domain like cyberlab123.onmicrosoft.com

Create a username and password (this becomes your global admin)

🔹 Step 3: Verify with Phone Number
Microsoft requires a valid phone number for identity verification. Use your own number or Google Voice if needed.

🔹 Step 4: Access the Admin Portal
Once setup is complete:

Go to: https://admin.microsoft.com

Log in with your new global admin account (e.g., admin@cyberlab123.onmicrosoft.com)

You now have full Microsoft 365 E5 access, including:

Email

Security portal

Defender for Office 365

Attack Simulation Training

🔹 Step 5: Go to Attack Simulation Training
Visit: https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator

Launch your first phishing campaign using built-in users or create new ones
